## camouf [0.11.0] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- **`ai-hallucinated-imports` — NodeNext/Node16 false positives eliminated (~30 FPs)** — The rule now reads `moduleResolution` and `module` from `tsconfig.json` and tries `.js→.ts`, `.jsx→.tsx`, `.mjs→.mts`, `.cjs→.cts` extension substitution when checking relative imports. Projects using `moduleResolution: NodeNext` (where `.js` imports resolve to `.ts` at compile-time) will no longer see spurious "hallucinated import" errors
- **`phantom-type-references` — Built-in type allowlist expanded from ~50 to ~200+ entries (~40 FPs)** — Added typed arrays (`Uint8Array`, `Int32Array`, `Float64Array`, etc.), `ArrayBuffer`, `DataView`, iterators/generators, `WeakRef`/`FinalizationRegistry`, error subclasses, Web APIs (`URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `AbortController`, `AbortSignal`, `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`, `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, `Blob`, `FormData`, `Crypto`, `Headers`, `Request`, `Response`, `WebSocket`, `Worker`, etc.), DOM observers, React utility types, and timer types. `isBuiltinType()` now also recognizes single-letter generics, `TKey`/`TValue`/`TResult` conventions, and namespace-qualified builtins like `NodeJS.Timeout`
- **`context-drift-patterns` — Token-based analysis reduces false positives on intentional naming (~15 FPs)** — Names like `buildSignedPayload` vs `buildIDSignedPayload` are now tokenized and compared structurally. When one name is a strict subsequence of the other with ≥1 distinguishing token, similarity is suppressed below the threshold. Concept-pattern matching (get/fetch, user/customer) also now compares surrounding context — different surrounding tokens indicate intentionally distinct functions

### Improved
- **`performance-antipatterns` — Smarter memory leak detection** — Event listener warnings now skip React `useEffect` scopes (cleanup handled by return function), recognize `AbortController`/`signal` as valid cleanup, and deduplicate warnings for the same event type. Array-in-loop detection uses a 15-line local window and recognizes `shift()`, `pop()`, `break`, `return` as valid size guards

### Changed
- CLI banner version updated to v0.11.0

---

## camouf [0.10.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **`async-discrepancies` rule** -- New builtin rule (19th) that detects async/await misuse patterns commonly introduced by AI coding assistants:
  - Unnecessary `async` functions that never use `await`
  - Floating promises (async calls without `await`, `.then()`, or `.catch()`)
  - `await` on non-Promise values (literals, booleans, numbers)
  - Mixed async patterns (`await` combined with `.then()` chains in the same function)
  - Mixed async patterns (`await` combined with error-first callbacks)
- **Async Discrepancies Guide** -- New documentation at `docs/async-discrepancies.md` covering the problem, detection categories, configuration, real-world scenarios, and a recommended complementary toolchain (ESLint, Biome, eslint-plugin-promise, TypeScript strict mode)
- **Test fixture** -- `test-fixtures/ai-errors/async-discrepancies.ts` with realistic examples of each async discrepancy category

### Changed
- README updated: 19 builtin rules (was 18), added `async-discrepancies` to AI-Specific rules table and CLI reference, documentation list now links to the async discrepancies guide
- CLI banner version updated to v0.10.0

---

## camouf [0.9.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **MCP Agent Tutorial** -- New comprehensive guide at `docs/mcp-agent-tutorial.md` covering setup, real-time streaming, multi-agent collaboration, and the validate-fix-revalidate loop with Claude CLI, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible agents
- **MCP `function-signature-matching` fix guidance** -- `camouf_suggest_fix` now returns specific step-by-step instructions for function-signature-matching violations, including function-name, parameter-name, and parameter-count mismatches. Previously only had a generic fallback
- **Demo scenario** -- `test-fixtures/demo/` with an e-commerce order system (shared types, client service, server controller) demonstrating typical AI naming drift and parameter-count mismatches across layers

### Changed
- README now links to the MCP Agent Tutorial from both the MCP section and the documentation list

### Removed
- Removed redundant `test-fixtures/camouf.config.json` (each test fixture directory has its own config)

---

## camouf [0.8.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Package Exports** — `exports` field in `package.json` with 5 entry points: `.`, `./types`, `./rules`, `./plugin`, `./testing`. Created `src/index.ts` barrel export with all public types for plugin authors
- **MCP Analyze Core Integration** — `camouf_analyze` MCP tool now uses real `ProjectScanner` and `DependencyAnalyzer` instead of `fs.readdir` fallback. Returns real dependency graph, layer detection, coupling metrics, and hotspots
- **Dynamic MCP Rules Resource** — `camouf://rules` resource now generated at runtime from `RuleEngine.getRules()`. Reflects config changes, plugin rules, enabled/disabled state. Replaces hardcoded 18-rule array
- **MCP Config Resource** — New `camouf://config` resource exposes active project configuration (name, languages, layers, rules, patterns) to AI agents
- **MCP Prompts** — 4 prompts teaching AI agents how to use Camouf:
  - `before-writing-code` — Analyze project architecture before generating code
  - `after-generating-code` — Validate and fix loop (max 3 iterations)
  - `understanding-violations` — Interpret severity levels and common AI violations
  - `project-conventions` — Discover active rules, layers, naming conventions
- **Plugin Scaffolding** — `camouf init --plugin` generates complete plugin project with package.json, tsconfig, entry point, rule template, and README. Supports `--yes` for non-interactive defaults
- **Testing Utilities** — `createRuleTestContext()` helper exported via `camouf/testing`. Builds a full `RuleContext` (graphlib graph, file contents, node/edge data) from a simple file map — no real project needed

### Changed
- MCP server now declares `prompts` capability alongside `tools` and `resources`
- `src/mcp/index.ts` exports `configResource` and registers prompts handlers

## camouf-plugin-react [0.2.1] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **Import from `camouf` package** — All types (`IRule`, `RuleContext`, `Violation`, `CamoufPlugin`, etc.) now imported from `camouf/rules` and `camouf` instead of local duplicate `types.ts`. Eliminates 174 lines of duplicated type definitions and prevents future drift
- Fixed `metadata.version` mismatch (`0.1.2` → `0.2.0` to match package.json)
- Updated `peerDependencies` from `>=0.4.0` to `>=0.7.0`
- Updated `camoufVersion` in plugin metadata from `>=0.4.0` to `>=0.7.0`

### Removed
- `src/types.ts` — Replaced by direct imports from `camouf` package exports

---

## camouf [0.7.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- Add npm downloads badge to README
- Update ASCII banner version to v0.7.0

## camouf [0.7.0] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Dramatically reduced false positives in `function-signature-matching`** — The rule was confusing field access on callback parameters (`node.data` from ReactFlow, `event.metaKey` from DOM, `item.dataKey` from Recharts, etc.) with internal API type field mismatches

### Added
- **Library-Aware Auto-Detection** — File imports are analyzed to detect which external libraries are in use (ReactFlow, Recharts, Express, Redux, Mongoose, Next.js, etc.) and automatically suppress their known object/field patterns
  - 15+ libraries with curated ignore patterns out of the box
  - New `LIBRARY_IGNORE_PATTERNS` registry inside the rule
- **`ignorePatterns` config option** — Simplified configuration to exclude false positives:
  ```json
  {
    "ignorePatterns": {
      "variables": ["node", "event", "item", "payload"],
      "properties": ["dataKey", "metaKey", "payload"]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Massively expanded built-in allowlists** — 150+ common object variable names (callback params like `item`, `entry`, `elem`, `val`, `acc`; framework objects like `store`, `dispatch`, `chart`, `canvas`) and 150+ common field names (DOM events, React props, chart properties, HTTP fields)

### Changed
- `isBuiltinObjectAccess` now uses `Set` instead of arrays for O(1) lookups (performance improvement on large codebases)
- External import detection now also tracks library names for context-aware analysis

## camouf [0.6.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Dramatically reduced false positives in `function-signature-matching` type field checks** - The rule was incorrectly flagging field access on external library objects (ReactFlow `node.data`, DOM `event.metaKey`, Recharts `payload.payload`, etc.) as type mismatches against internal API schemas

### Added
- **External import auto-detection** (`ignoreExternalImports`, default: `true`) — Automatically parses `import`/`require` statements and skips field access checks on variables imported from `node_modules` packages
- **Ignore field patterns** (`ignoreFieldPatterns`) — User-configurable patterns to exclude from type field checks, with wildcard support:
  - Exact: `"node.data"` 
  - Object wildcard: `"event.*"` (any field on event)
  - Field wildcard: `"*.metaKey"` (metaKey on any object)
- **External library objects list** (`externalLibraryObjects`) — User-configurable list of additional variable names to always skip (e.g. `"node"` from ReactFlow)
- **Expanded built-in allowlist** — Added 80+ common objects and fields from DOM, React, Express, Node.js, and test frameworks to the skip list

### Example config
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "builtin": {
      "function-signature-matching": {
        "level": "error",
        "options": {
          "ignoreFieldPatterns": ["node.*", "event.*", "payload.payload"],
          "externalLibraryObjects": ["graph", "chart"],
          "ignoreExternalImports": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## camouf [0.6.1] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Scan Progress Reporting** - Real-time progress feedback during project scanning for large codebases
  - Spinner now shows file-by-file progress: `Scanning [127/1843] (6%) src/core/rules/...`
  - Three-phase feedback: discovering files → parsing (with counter) → building dependency graph
  - Long file paths automatically truncated for clean terminal output
  - CI mode emits progress via debug logs (no ANSI escape codes)
  - Applied to `validate`, `analyze`, and `watch` commands

## camouf [0.6.0] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Redesigned CLI Help** - Rich interactive help with ASCII banner, grouped commands, inline options, examples, available rules list, and docs links
- **CLI Reference in README** - Full CLI output shown in README for instant engagement
- **Test Fixtures: client/server/shared structure** - Realistic cross-boundary test files for `function-signature-matching` rule
  - `shared/user.types.ts` and `shared/payment.types.ts` with canonical APIs
  - `client/user-service.ts` and `client/payment-handler.ts` with AI-drifted function calls
  - `server/user-controller.ts` with mismatched server implementations

### Fixed
- **`fix-signatures` now works correctly** - Was returning "No mismatches found" because test-fixtures had empty `client`/`server` directories in config
- **Unknown command handling** - Shows helpful error message instead of crash
- **`--help` and no-args behavior** - Shows custom help instead of default Commander output

### Changed
- Updated `test-fixtures/camouf.config.json` with proper layer definitions and 10 enabled rules
- Removed duplicated Commands section from README (replaced with CLI Reference link)

## camouf [0.5.0] - 2025-02-07

### Added
- **5 New AI-Specific Rules** - Purpose-built to catch AI coding assistant mistakes:
  - `ai-hallucinated-imports` - Detects imports of non-existent files/modules (AI "hallucinates" paths)
  - `context-drift-patterns` - Finds when the same concept gets different names across files (User vs Customer vs Account)
  - `phantom-type-references` - Catches references to types that don't exist or were renamed
  - `inconsistent-casing` - Detects mixing of camelCase/snake_case in the same codebase
  - `orphaned-functions` - Finds functions that are declared but never called anywhere

- **MCP Server Integration** - AI agents can now call Camouf directly:
  - `camouf mcp` command starts the Model Context Protocol server
  - Tools: `camouf_validate`, `camouf_analyze`, `camouf_suggest_fix`
  - Compatible with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-enabled agents
  - See README for configuration examples

- **Test Fixtures** - Example files in `test-fixtures/ai-errors/` demonstrating all AI rules

### Changed

- Report command properly passes file contents for signature analysis

## camouf [0.3.2] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- `camouf.js` entry point shim so `node camouf.js` works as fallback when agents guess the entry point

### Fixed
- Agent templates (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, slash commands) now explicitly instruct to use `npx camouf` and warn against `node camouf.js` or bare `camouf`
- Prevents agents from guessing wrong invocation method

## camouf [0.3.1] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- `camouf init --agent <type>` now implies `--yes` (non-interactive mode) so AI agents don't hang on interactive prompts
- Previously required `--yes` flag in addition to `--agent`, which broke agent workflows

## camouf [0.3.0] - 2026-02-04
